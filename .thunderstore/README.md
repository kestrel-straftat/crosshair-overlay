# Crosshair Overlay

This mod allows you to overlay your own custom crosshair (or any image you want) over the game.

## Usage

All customisation options are available through the mod's config file~ these include:

- Tinting the image, and modifying the opacity
- Changing the size of the image
- Changing the offset of the image from the center of the screen
- Whether to hide the default crosshair
- Whether to overlay or underlay the image relative to UI
- Whether the crosshair should be hidden in the main menu

To change the crosshair, place a png or jpeg image in the mod's install directory, and
change the config option `File name` to the name of the image (with extension).
