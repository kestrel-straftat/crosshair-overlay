### v1.1.2

- Fixed mod for Straftat v1.3.3
- If you use a mod manager, this update likely deleted your crosshair. Sorry!
- This will probably be the last update the mod gets for a while~ it's in a. fairly stable state
(and something better might be coming...)

### v1.1.1

- Added option to disable the crosshair overlay when using a scope (on by default)
